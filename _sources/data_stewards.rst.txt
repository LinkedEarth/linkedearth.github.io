Standard Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the main products from the NSF EarthCube LinkedEarth grant was the creation of data standards for paleoclimate data.

A data standard is actually comprised of three components:

1. A representation for the data, such as `LiPD <https://lipd.net>`_ and `its associated ontology <http://linkedearth.github.io/Ontology/release/index.html>`.
2. A standard vocabulary for the data, which has been developed by NOAA (`PaST Thesaurus <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/data-access/paleoclimatology-data/past-thesaurus>`_)
3. Standard guidelines for reporting of the data, which are provided by PaCTS `crowdsourced standard for the reporting of paleoclimate data (PaCTS) <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019PA003632>`_. The work involved 135 researchers worldwide and was highlighted by the American Geophysical Union (AGU)'s `research highlights <https://eos.org/research-spotlights/standardizing-the-surge-of-paleoclimate-data>`_ and at the `Fall Meeting 2019 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjkSGnlNwX0&list=PL7Ihm2Mh3MZ5ff8PVBZ3dBLYQdwZLQlEY&index=32>`_.

LiPDverse
^^^^^^^^^

The `LiPDverse <https://lipdverse.org>`_ stores datasets in the LiPD format. Most of these files originated in collaboration with PAGES projects and the metadata has been fully vetted by the community.

The LiPDverse allows for simple queries and visualization of LiPD-formatted datasets.
