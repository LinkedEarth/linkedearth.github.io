Data Stewardship
================

Standard Development
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the main products from the NSF EarthCube LinkedEarth grant was the creation of data standards for paleoclimate data.

A data standard is actually comprised of three components:

1. A representation for the data, such as `LiPD`_ and its associated `ontology`_.
2. A standard vocabulary for the data, which has been developed by NOAA (`PaST Thesaurus`_)
3. Standard guidelines for reporting of the data, which are outlined in the `PaCTS standard`_. The work involved 135 researchers worldwide and was highlighted by the American Geophysical Union (AGU)'s `research highlights <https://eos.org/research-spotlights/standardizing-the-surge-of-paleoclimate-data>`_ and at the `Fall Meeting 2019 <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjkSGnlNwX0&list=PL7Ihm2Mh3MZ5ff8PVBZ3dBLYQdwZLQlEY&index=32>`_.

LiPD playground
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `LiPD playground`_ is a web interface that allows to easily create LiPD files. The interface includes a `recommender system (PaleoRec)`_ that assists in metadata information. PaleoRec uses deep learning for recommendation. Technical details are summarized in `this paper <https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/environmental-data-science/article/paleorec-a-sequential-recommender-system-for-the-annotation-of-paleoclimate-datasets/30B71DFD01C99A3773B4CEAAB2497B2D>`_.

LiPDverse
^^^^^^^^^

The `LiPDverse`_ stores datasets in the LiPD format, which are also available through a `graph interface`_. Most of these files originated in collaboration with PAGES projects and the metadata has been fully vetted by the community.

The LiPDverse allows for simple queries and visualization of LiPD-formatted datasets.
