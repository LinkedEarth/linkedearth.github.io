Analysis
========

Open source software
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LinkedEarth team currently maintain the following open source packages:

* Utilities that enable users to open, manipulate, and write files using the `Linked Paleo Data (LiPD)`_ format.
    * For R: `lipdR`_
    * For Python: `PyLiPD`_
* `GeoChronR`_: an integrated framework in R that allows scientists to generate state-of-the-art age models for their records, create time-uncertain ensembles of their data, analyze those ensembles with  a number of commonly-used techniques, and visualize their results in an intuitive way.
* `Pyleoclim`_: a Python package designed for the analysis of paleoclimate data. Pyleoclim leverages various data science libraries (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn) for time series analysis, as well as and Matplotlib and Cartopy for the creation of publication-quality figures. The package is designed around object-oriented Series, which can be directly manipulated for plotting, spectral and wavelet analysis, and other time series-appropriate operations.

Both GeoChronR and Pyleoclim natively "speaks" the language of LiPD.

Computational Narratives
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

* We have a `library of Jupyter Notebooks`_ illustrating the use of Pyleoclim in paleoclimate research.
* We maintain a a compendium of digital resources called `PaleoBooks`_  to bridge the gap between paleoclimate observations and models.
* R vignettes are available from the `GeoChronR Github repository`_.
* `autoTS`_: an automated system for time series analysis.
* `ClimateDISK`_: a framework to test and revise hypotheses based on automatic analysis of scientific data as it becomes available over time.

See our :ref:`Gallery <gallery>` for examples of fully executable notebooks.
