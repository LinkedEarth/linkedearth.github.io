Community
==========

Updates
^^^^^^^
The `CyberPaleo blog`_  disseminates updates from the LinkedEarth team and affiliates, as well as guest posts from various partners.

Discussion
^^^^^^^^^^
- Discourse: Announcements and general discussion is done through `this forum`_. This is also a great place to ask for help with our tools (e.g. Pyleoclim, GeoChronR, LiPD). This is the best place to start getting involved with LinkedEarth.
- SLACK:  Our Slack workspace is mainly used for hackathons. `Email us`_ for an invitation.
- GITHUB: All technical discussion should go through GitHub. Please do so in the "issues" section of project-specific GitHub repositories (e.g. `Pyleoclim repository`_). All of our packages follow the `Open Development`_ model. See each repository for guidelines.

Training
^^^^^^^^

We offer training opportunities through the following modalities:

- Self-paced tutorials to learn `basic Python`_

- `Time-Uncertain Data Analysis in R`_, a suite of self-paced tutorials in Rmarkdown.

- `PyleoTutorials`_, a suite of self-paced tutorials as Jupyter Notebooks.

- Video tutorials through our `YouTube channel <https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCo7yzNTM__4g5H-xyWV5KbA>`_ :

  * `Pyleoclim Video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LJaQBFMK2-Q&list=PL93NbaRnKAuF4WpIQf-4y_U4lo-GqcrcW>`_.

    * Previous hackathon materials (2021, 2022, 2023) are available through our `paleoHackathon GitHub repository`_. The notebooks are released through myBinder and hosted on its own JupyterHub. `Email us`_ for a Hub account.
    * Future hackathons are TBD. Keep an eye on our `Twitter <https://twitter.com/Linked_Earth>`_ and `Discourse <https://discourse.linked.earth/>`_ for updates.

  * FROGS: TBD

  * GeoChronR workshops (2016, 2017, 2021, 2022)

Compilation Working Groups
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `LiPDverse`_ has information on a number of paleo compilation projects have that adopted LinkedEarth tools.
