Discussion

- SLACK: Announcements and general discussion is done through our Slack workspace. `Email us <mailto:linkedearth@gmail.com>`_ for an invitation. This is the best place to start getting involved with LinkedEarth.
- GITHUB: All technical discussion should go through GitHub. Please use project-specific GitHub repositories (e.g. `Pyleoclim repository <https://github.com/LinkedEarth/Pyleoclim_util>`_). All of our packages follow the `Open Development <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software_development>`_ model. See each repository for guidelines.
