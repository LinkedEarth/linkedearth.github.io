Climate Reconstructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LinkedEarth team has been involved in the `Last Millennium Reanalysis`_. Version 2 of the dataset is `available from NOAA`_.

The LinkedEarth team has also been funded through a `NSF Geoinformatics grant`_ to develop a `Paleoclimate Reconstruction Storehouse (PReSto)`_. The goal is to provide broad access to paleoclimate reconstructions on the internet.

The team has been involved in various projects with PAGES:

* `Pages2k`_
* `Iso2k`_
* `CoralHydro2k`_
* `Temp12k <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3>`_.

As well as with the German-funded `PALMOD`_ project.

The data for these projects are available in LiPD format through the `LiPDverse`_.
