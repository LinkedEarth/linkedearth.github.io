Climate Reconstructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The LinkedEarth team has been involved in the `Last Millennium Reanalysis (LMR) <https://cpo.noaa.gov/News/News-Article/ArtMID/6226/ArticleID/1807/Last-Millennium-Reanalysis-now-at-NOAAs-National-Centers-for-Environmental-Information-marking-major-milestone>`_. Version 2 of the dataset is `available from NOAA <https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/paleo-search/study/27850>`_.

The LinkedEarth team has also been funded through a `NSF Geoinformatics grant <https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1948746&HistoricalAwards=false>`_ to develop a `Paleoclimate Reconstruction Storehouse (PReSto) <http://paleopresto.github.io/>`_. The goal is to provide broad access to paleoclimate reconstructions on the internet.

Partnership
^^^^^^^^^^^

The team has been involved in various projects with PAGES:

* `Pages2k <http://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/2k-network/intro>`_

*  `Iso2k <http://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/2k-network/projects/iso2k/intro>`_

* `CoralHydro2k <https://pastglobalchanges.org/science/wg/2k-network/projects/coral-hydro/intro>`_

* `Temp12k <https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-020-0445-3>`_.

As well as with the German-funded `PALMOD <https://www.palmod.de>`_ project.

The data for these projects are available in LiPD format `through the LiPDverse <https://lipdverse.org>`_.
